spatula: I just try to ugh.. extend my life
spatula: Enu your just have to be patient I guess..in terms of reading
spatula: why?
Enumaris: I keep mising moves
spatula: same....
Enumaris: I read up to H2 when I played D2 and thought I just won
spatula: I miss ataris
spatula: I mean shortage of liberty
spatula: I can't really see that when I read..
spatula: so.. often take me a long time to do tsumego that involve golden chicken
Enumaris: I see all the basic tesuji easily but then don't confirm that they actually work
Enumaris: cus I'm stupid
spatula: Enu.. don't be sad
spatula: I mean.. you need to let me win some games
spatula: else or hyakubango...
spatula: is gonna end prematurely lol
Enumaris: I don't mind losing, it's more I mind that I keep misreading basic stuff
Enumaris: cus I'm dumb
spatula: ugh... it's gonna take a while for me to catch up...
Enumaris: it's a misread if I thought it was dead and I didn't bother to go down that road
Enumaris: but I guess I would also mind if I somehow lost just due to a slow grind hmm
Enumaris: I guess I'm just a really sore loser
Enumaris: lol
